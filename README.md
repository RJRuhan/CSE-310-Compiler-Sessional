## **Compiler Development: Symbol Table, Lexical & Semantic Analysis, and Intermediate Code Generation**  

### **Project Overview**  
This project involves building essential components of a compiler, including **symbol table management, lexical and semantic analysis, and intermediate code generation** for the **x86 architecture**.  

### **Key Contributions**  
- 📌 **Symbol Table**: Designed an efficient data structure for managing identifiers, scopes, and type information.  
- 🔍 **Lexical Analyzer**: Implemented using **Flex** to tokenize source code efficiently.  
- 🛠️ **Semantic Analyzer**: Developed with **Bison** to enforce language rules and ensure syntactic correctness.  
- ⚙️ **Intermediate Code Generation**: Generated optimized **x86 assembly code**.  

### **Technical Skills**  
💻 **Flex, Bison, x86 Assembly, C**
